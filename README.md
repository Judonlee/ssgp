# SSGP
## Source separation Gaussian process (SSGP) models for audio signals, using variational sparse GPs.
Code used to get results in the paper: *Sparse Gaussian process Audio Source Separation Using Spectrum Priors in the Time-Domain*. 

This implementation uses [GPflow][1] version 0.5, and [gpitch][2] version 2.0 (a copy is provided in this repository).
